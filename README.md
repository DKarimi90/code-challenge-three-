# Wk 2 CODE CHALLENGE 
## Goals 
- Implementing a `mini` web application using JavaScript <br>
- Assessing the progress of coding skills (DOM manipulation, Event listeners & Server communication) <br>
- Meeting Moringa School's academic requirements 
## Project Description 
For this project, I will be using inbuilt fetch function to obtain data from an internal/local .json file `db.json`. The file contains movie details, which I am required to display on the window for the `users`. A `user` should be able to see the movies' details, menu and buy ticket. 
## Project Setup
No special installation is required to run the code. As such, code can successfully be run on chrome browser using the `live server` extension on the terminal. <br>
I am required to meet three core deliverables as described below: 
### DOM Manipulation 
Adding content to the user interface using DOM manipulation. 
### Event Handling 
Integrating event listeners to the DOM 
### Communication with Server 
Using inbuilt fetch function to access and manipulate data from the server (in the current case scenario, successfully deriving and manipulating data from a local `json` file).
